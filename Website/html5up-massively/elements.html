						<h2>Sonar API</h2>
						<p>In January, the AI-powered search engine <b>Perplexity</b> launched the <strong>Sonar API</strong>, enabling automated access to Perplexity AI. When users highlight text using <b>Truthly</b>, a structured prompt is sent to Sonar. 
						The response includes a truthfulness summary of the highlighted content—presented as a percentage, a concise explanation, and a list of the top five supporting sources.</p>
						<h2>More about Perplexity</h2>
						<p>Perplexity stands out in the crowded AI landscape by combining the power of a large language model with real-time web access, delivering answers that are not only intelligent but also up-to-date and backed by verifiable sources. Unlike many other AI tools that rely solely on static training data, 
						Perplexity continuously searches the internet to provide accurate, current, and citation-rich responses.</p>
						<h2>Mongo DB - last but not least</h2>
						<p>To provide you with the most diverse and accurate information tailored to your interests, our "Related Searches" page is powered by MongoDB—a leading NoSQL database designed for speed, scalability, and flexibility. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON, which makes it ideal for handling the dynamic and unstructured data generated by user interactions. With its ability to handle large volumes of data, MongoDB ensures our platform remains fast, responsive, and ready to scale.</p>
